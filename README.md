## 📌 Overview  
**Jodelle Power Mining** is a **revived and enhanced** version of an old mining plugin originally created by **bloodyshade** (2013). Since the original plugin was abandoned, I took the initiative to **update, maintain, and improve** it for modern Spigot servers!  

This plugin introduces **special PowerTools** that allow **efficient block breaking**, such as **3x3 mining with hammers and excavators**.  

🔹 **Mine faster.**  
🔹 **Dig smarter.**  
🔹 **Customize everything.**
